This is my first TOP's project. By the end of this project I'll have created a basic web page by solely applying what I've been taught about basic HTML structure. This project shall include:
> A main h1 element;
> Some pragraphs
> Hyperlinks;
> Eventually unordered/ordered lists;
> Some beautiful images to enhance the user's experience;
